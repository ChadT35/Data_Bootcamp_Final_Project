# Data_Bootcamp_Final_Project
This project was completed by Chad P. Tsikalas in partial fulfilment of ECON-UB.0232, Data Bootcamp, Spring 2018. I certify that the NYU Stern Honor Code applies to this project. In particular, I have:

Clearly acknowledged the work and efforts of others when submitting written work as our own. The incorporation of the work of others–including but not limited to their ideas, data, creative expression, and direct quotations (which should be designated with quotation marks), or paraphrasing thereof– has been fully and appropriately referenced using notations both in the text and the bibliography.
And I understand that:

Submitting the same or substantially similar work in multiple courses, either in the same semester or in a different semester, without the express approval of all instructors is strictly forbidden.

I acknowledge that a failure to abide by NYU Stern Honor Code will result in a failing grade for the project and course.

# Project Description
The salary cap was instituted in the National Football League in 1994 in an attempt to promote parity and fair competition among the league. Starting at $34 million, the salary cap has grown every year and is calculated by equally distributing league revenues. In 2017, the salary cap was $167 million. The rule achieved its goals as NFL dynasties and long-term dominance has declined since the inception of the salary cap. Each year, General Managers (GMs) must distribute their fixed cap among 53 active players, injured reserve players, and practice squad players. Despite a few obscure ceilings and floors, GMs can distribute their salary cap in any way. This analysis will research a) the way that GMs distribute their salary cap and b) the on-field results of different salary cap distributions among position groups.
